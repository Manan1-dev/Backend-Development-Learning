# Backend Notes

## Why notes on backend needed?

Everytime I try to learn something I can understand it better if I write each section’s working by my own hand and in my own words. By doing so, I am able to learn the front-end part (haven't explored the React yet).

This repo, basically is for my journey of Backend Development like how I learn the backend. First, it'll have a folder, NodeJS, where I will learn the core modules that needed to learn before working as Software Developer. After that, more folders will be added as needed.

## Project Setup

-   Visual Studio Code
-   Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher).
-   Postman

These are the core requirements till now according to me. Third party libraries will be listed where it will be used with proper reasoning why it was used.
